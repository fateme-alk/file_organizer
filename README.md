# file_organizer
This project is a Python script that helps you organize files in a directory by grouping them into separate
folders based on their last modification date and file extensions.

   git clone https://github.com/fateme-alk/file_organizer.git
   ```
2. Run python script

   ```
   src_dir is the directory that you're untidy files are there
